      <p>I build security systems with precision.<br>
         I design cyber defense from the ground up.<br>
         I craft systems that hold the line.<br>
         I architect networks.<br>
         I harden systems.<br><br>
         I build systems that speak for themselves.<br>
         If you're under attack—I'm ready.<br>
         My tools are already built. My methods are proven.<br><br>
         I act based on your business needs—<br>
         not noise, not panic.<br><br>
         This isn't a pitch. It's a posture.
